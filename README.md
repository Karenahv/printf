## 0x11. C - printf

Printf function with the printing features of characters (c), strings (s), % (%), octales (0), hexadecimals ( x and X). We also did a 
bunary function (b)

We create a mini function printf like that of the C language, we document with the book the secrets of printf.
We use the putchar function of the syscall writer function. and we work with data structures,
with a structure called from the holberton.h

- All codes will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
