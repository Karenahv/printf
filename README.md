## 0x11. C - printf

This project is for  replicate the C standard library printf() function

What you should learn from this project:

- Applying variadic functions
- The complexities of printf function
- How to use git in a team setting
- Hoe to work in a team


Printf function with  the printing features of characters (c), strings (s), % (%), octales (0), hexadecimals ( x and X). We also did a 
bunary function (b)

We create a mini function printf like that of the C language, we document with the book the secrets of printf.
We use the putchar function of the syscall writer function. and we work with data structures,
with a structure called from the holberton.h


- All codes will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c


file   |   Description
--|--
holberton.h | A file for call to prototypes and structurs
_putchar.c | A file for call to syscall (writer)  putchar print  in _printf
_printf.c | A file  for call base structur from holberton.h
binary.c | A file for print binary numbers
hexa.c | A file for print hexa numbers
man_3_printf | A file man type for printf function
octales.c | A file for print octals numbers
rot13.c | A file for print encripted numbers in rot13
unsig_num.c | A file for print unsigned numbers

## Prototype
``` int _printf(const char *format, ...);```
