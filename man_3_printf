.B Return value
.sp
ON succes, _printf returns the numbers of characters printed. If
.I format
is NULL or if the functions encounters any arrores, it returns -1

.SH NOTES
_printf  uses a custom character printing function called _putchar, that uses the system call write().
_putchar uses a static buffer of 1024 bytes and static incrementing variable.
That way, everytime _putchar is called inside _printf,  the caracter is stored inside the buffer and the function moves t the nex character, until _printf calls _putchar(-1).
